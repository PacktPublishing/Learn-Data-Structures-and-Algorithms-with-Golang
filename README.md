**Level up your Go programming skills to develop faster and more efficient code**

## What is this book about?
Golang is one of the fastest growing programming languages in the software industry. Its speed, simplicity, and reliability make it the perfect choice for building robust applications. This brings the need to have a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms with Go so as to build scalable applications. Complete with hands-on tutorials, this book will guide you in using the best data structures and algorithms for problem solving.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Improve application performance using the most suitable data structure and algorithm 
* Explore the wide range of classic algorithms such as recursion and hashing algorithms 
* Work with algorithms such as garbage collection for efficient memory management 
* Analyze the cost and benefit trade-off to identify algorithms and data structures for problem solving 
* Explore techniques for writing pseudocode algorithm and ace whiteboard coding in interviews 
* Discover the pitfalls in selecting data structures and algorithms by predicting their speed and efficiency

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
//main package has examples shown
// in Hands-On Data Structures and algorithms with Go book
package main
// importing fmt package
import (
"fmt"
)
// main method
func main() {
fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```
